def to_cycles(ms : float) -> int:
    u"""Convert exposure time from milliseconds to cycles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ms
        Exposure time in milliseconds. Valid exposure times are
        from 0.02ms to 1310.0ms. ``ms`` is clamped to these
        values to guarantee the return value is a valid exposure
        time.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Exposure time in cycles.

def to_ms(cycles: int) -> float:

    Parameters
    ----------
    cycles
        Time in cycles. One cycle is 20Âµs.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Time in milliseconds.

    Notes
    -----
    Dev-kit firmware measures exposure time in units of cycles
    and stores exposure time as a 16-bit unsigned integer. The
    smallest exposure time is 1 cycle. The largest exposure time
    is 65500 (1310.0ms).
