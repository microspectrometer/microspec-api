    Parameters
    ----------
    cycles
        Time in cycles. One cycle is 20Âµs.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Time in milliseconds.

    Notes
    -----
    Dev-kit firmware measures exposure time in units of cycles
    and stores exposure time as a 16-bit unsigned integer. The
    smallest exposure time is 1 cycle. The largest exposure time
    is 65500 (1310.0ms).
